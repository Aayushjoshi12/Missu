    <br>
    <h1 class="head" >2024 February 1:-One Year</h1>
    <p class="p1">
      Finally, it was a year and so many things happened. I completed my SEE exam with 3.30 GPA, which was unexpected. I had gone to KTM with my dad for his report. And the report was bad and we returned to Dhangadhi after that. And from the day of the report, he felt weak and sick day by day. And after 3 months of holiday, I joined Galaxy College.
<br>
      And the days were going and he became more weak day by day. And as the doctor said, cancer cells started to transfer from one place to another and it was like impossible to stop them. And one day, he felt very pain when he was alone. I was at college and my brother was at school and my mum was in the shop. He was alone in his room. He felt so much pain and got faint and my mum came to his room to take clothes and saw him and called Hitesh uncle (Doctor) and took him to the hospital. And uncle said the pain was going to be more and more. And from that day, he felt pain so much pain. And the days were going with pain. After some days, cancer gave its impact to his brain. Now, he was not in his control. He said someone was coming. It felt like he became mad. And again one day at the time of Dashain, his oxygen level went down and again we took him to the hospital. And to save his life, the doctor said to put a pipe in his neck. After putting the pipe, he was like normal for few days. And because of this, we had our Dashain.
    <br>  
      But now, we knew he did not have too many days with us. It was so much painful for him because blood was coming from his neck. He could not breathe easily. He had to take a special medicine to stop that pain for a while. That medicine was not given to anyone easily because it was used by patients who got into accidents and were in so much pain. And by doctor‚Äôs permission, we could buy it. Firstly, it was done with half cc but after the days were going, pain became more and more and we had to increase the dose. Again after few days, his oxygen level went down and again we went to the hospital. It was like we had to go to the hospital 2 to 3 times a week. The doctor told us to get an oxygen cylinder at home. And now, because of low level of oxygen, he needed an oxygen cylinder to maintain his oxygen level. The days were becoming bad and bad day by day. Because of blood from his neck, we again had to go to the hospital. And this was the last time we went there because on Kartik 26, 3:30 PM, I lost my dad. It was a black day for me. The man whom I loved the most, I lost him. I always miss you, daddy. He never said anything to me. I still cry when I think about him. I was always lucky to have him in my life. He did everything for his family. My dad loved cooking food. He cooked better than mum. I always miss his food.
      <br>
      And from that day, I started hating her because if I had not fallen in love with her, I could spend more time with my dad. And because of that, I hid her face from here. I don‚Äôt like her now. It was like I had no feeling with her.
      <br>
      This year was very bad and I hope nobody feels the pain that my dad felt during cancer time.
      <br>
      At last, FUCK YOU CANCER.
      <br>
      Thank you.
